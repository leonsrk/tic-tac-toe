# TicTacToe with Pygame

This is a simple TicTacToe game I made using Python and  the Pygame libary. <br>
You can play against a bot which will try to prevent you from winning to gatter the win for himself.


## Installing
To run the code you need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

To install Pygame run the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```


## Running my game
To run my TicTacToe game you need to download the source code from this repository and run the main.py file in a IDE of your choice. <br>
I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
